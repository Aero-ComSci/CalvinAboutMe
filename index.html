        <p>
              "After many years of experincing various stuff, my goal was set on obtaining a spftware programming job. 
              My plans to achive the goal is to do well in the computer science field, learn how many programming
              softwares work do good in college for good credentials for a software programming job. I decided on software 
              programming because it standed out to me more, and other career jobs isn't really my grove."  
        <p>
        <h3>Characteristics In Jobs</h3>
        </p>
              "A characteristic I had to aid me in achiving my goal is being able to adapt quickly to something new regarding coding
              and being able to understand how something works by seeing it for myself.(Example: MIT App Inventor.) " Some characteristic
              traits I have is being calm in situations, bein open-minded and cautious of mistakes or problems. A accomplishment I have is 
              the ablity to strategize time-wise with work lasting days or even weeks.
        </p>
        <h3>Activities and Work Skills</h3>
        <p>
              "Some activities I have participated in are the FMP ones and the rallies. From my experince as a high schooler. I realised 
              that getting good grades is needed, have fun while I still can and make new friends. I don't have much work experince besides
              knowing how the system works, how money is made, and investments."
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              "Overall, my career goal is landing in software programming. Before that however, I would need to learn about software 
              programming, get good gardes and ensure that happens. I have characteristics that maybe be more suited to this job, and
              hopefully utlize it to my advantage. I am able to stratigize with time and in school, I hope to get good grades, have fun and 
              make new friends before high school ends. Thanks for reading my about me section, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the website."
